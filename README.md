# DriverPass System Design Portfolio

This repository showcases my work on the DriverPass project, a system developed to enhance driver training through online scheduling and practice test features. The client, DriverPass, requested a web-based system to streamline lesson scheduling, provide practice exams, and track user progress. This system aims to improve driving test success rates and make training more accessible and user-friendly.

## Project Overview

### Project One: Business Requirements Document
The Business Requirements Document defines DriverPass’s goals and requirements for the system, addressing both functional and nonfunctional needs to ensure usability and security. Key requirements include:
- **Functional**: Allows users to schedule lessons, access practice tests, and view progress.
- **Nonfunctional**: Ensures the platform is accessible on desktops and mobile devices, maintains data security, and supports timely updates aligned with DMV policy changes.

### Project Two: System Design Document
The System Design Document expands on the requirements, providing a detailed technical design with UML diagrams to illustrate system components and interactions. Key elements include:
- **Use Case Diagram**: Visualizes main actors (e.g., Customer, Secretary, IT Officer) and their interactions with the system’s core functions.
- **Activity Diagrams**: Show step-by-step flows for scheduling lessons and taking practice tests.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Outlines the interaction flow for lesson scheduling.
- **Class Diagram**: Defines core classes, such as Customer, Appointment, and TrainingPackage, along with their relationships, to clarify the system’s data structure.

## Reflection

### Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a secure, accessible system for driver training that enables users to book lessons, complete practice tests, and monitor progress. This design aims to simplify DriverPass’s training process, enhance user satisfaction, and ensure system effectiveness.

### Strengths and Areas for Improvement
One strength of this project was the thorough documentation, which clearly outlined system requirements and design processes. If I were to improve one aspect, I would refine the relationships in the class diagram to enhance flexibility and support future system updates.

### Understanding User Needs
The system design emphasizes understanding user needs to create a smooth, intuitive experience. Focusing on user requirements ensures the system is user-friendly and meets the client’s expectations.

### Approach to System Design
In future projects, I would focus more on collecting comprehensive user feedback to refine requirements and catch potential issues early. Additionally, modular design techniques will ensure adaptability, making future maintenance easier and more efficient.
